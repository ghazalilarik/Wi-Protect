*"When your ESP8266 tells intruders: 'Access Denied!'"*

## Overview
This ESP8266-based project combines Wi-Fi network disruption detection with location-based access control. It monitors for deauthentication attacks (a form of Wi-Fi jamming), alerts users to disruptions, and restricts access based on device proximity to the ESP8266, providing an added layer of security.

## Features
- **Network Disruption Detection**: Monitors for jamming attempts by detecting deauthentication frames and provides alerts.
- **Location-Based Access Control**: Restricts network access based on signal strength (RSSI) to ensure only nearby
